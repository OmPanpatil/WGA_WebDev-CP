//Js the language : Code likhna seekhna, main features
//JS the DOM : COde likhkar cheezein banana seekhna

    1. Basics : file connect karna, load karna script ko, basics of code execution, grammar & understanding of errors..
    -> It follows the sequence of line of code in JS.

    2. Inbuilt Features => Console, alert, prompt,
    -> Browser 
    
    3. Variables :
    var a = 3;

    4. Constants :
        const c = '5;
        const d = 'apple';

    5. Compiler & Interpreters :


    6. Window : It is a bucket of tools that browser offers to use in JS language.
    
    7. Types : Types means data types.
        ->like will u have dinner ? Y or N
        - String : 'Harsh';
        - Integer : 12;
        - float : 12.42;
        - boolean : True/False;
        - character : a,b,c,...;

        Type is of two types : 
            a. Primitive DataTypes -->12,12.4,Harsh, True or false, a, null, undefined.
            b. Reference DataTypes --> [], {},() these are called as reference DataTypes.


    8. Conditionals
    9. Loops
    10. FUnctions :
        --> Functions are reusable, first class functions in js as they can work as a Variables
        -->Js is divided into two parts as a.ES5 and b.ES6
        - ES5 is divided into three parts :
            1. Simple Function Statement
            2. Function Expression
            3. Anonymous functions
        - ES6 :
            ->1. Fat Arrow Functions 
                    - a. Basic Fat Arrow Functions
                    - b. Fat Arrow functions with one parameter
                    - c. Fat arrow function with implicit returns.

    14. Prototypal inheritance
    15. Asynchronous JS
    16. ES6 Climax
    17. Questions solving

Setup : first link it to the html file. And then write the boiler plate code for css.

*{
    margin:0;
    padding:0;
    box-sizing:border box;
}

html,body{
    width:100%;
    height:100%;
}

Element Selection : 
ex: h1{
    color: red;
}

##Table of content :

1. width & height, color & bgcolour : Color = text ka color, bgcolor = bg ka color,
2. Font-family (There are two types of fonts : Sans-Serif and Serif.
Sans-Serif : It is the one which does not have the sharp edges. example : Montserrat
Serif: It is the one where the sharp edges are present. Example : Playfair display. 
) ,
3. font-size, 

## Units: A measurement of something

-> Our desktops or laptops scrren can have dpi(Depth per inch) like in a certain space of screen how many pixels can be present at a time &

- px (A complete bad experience for the user because it gives a scroll i.e. it's not responsive. A few times can be used but we have to be responsible because every screen has it's own DPI's values or quality.) , 
% (Total like jitna total hai utna part & it changes according to the screen can be called responsiveness) , 
vw (Viewport width : When we say suppose for example 10vw it will take the 10th value part from the 100% value of the width screen. ) , 
vh (Viewport height : it will take the screen value.), 
em (It depends on that element font-size & if the value has been given to the parent then it will get automatically applied to the children also.) , 
rem (Also known as Root Empherial unit : It depends upon the root of HTML tag. For Example : 
html{
    font-size : 16px;
}
box{
    width:3rem;
    height:3rem;
    bgcolor: red;
}
)

## % always take values from the parent & Vw and Vh always takes the value from the screen.

- min/max-width and max/min-height : It is a like a hook that will not maximize or minimize after that certain values.
